# NextAuth Session Issue in getServerSideProps

This repository demonstrates a problem with NextAuth session handling within `getServerSideProps` in Next.js 15.  The authentication status isn't consistently reflected, leading to unexpected behavior.

## Problem Description

The `about.js` file attempts to access the NextAuth session using `unstable_getServerSession`.  While the session is retrieved, the UI doesn't always accurately reflect the logged-in/logged-out status.  This inconsistency might manifest as the wrong content being displayed, intermittent errors, or a complete lack of session awareness. 

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.
2.  Ensure you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Follow the NextAuth setup guide to configure your authentication providers.

## How to reproduce

1. Run the development server using `npm run dev`.
2. Navigate to the `/about` page.
3. Observe the authentication status.  It may or may not correctly reflect your login state.
